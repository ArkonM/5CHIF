What is a collection
A collection is an ordered group of element, all of the same type
Similar to single dimensional Arrays

Collections are generally much faster than using SQL
Collections enable BULK COLLECT and FORALL to boost multi-row SQL performance

Collections are generally much, much faster because it is located in the PGA memory (Process Global Area)
Accessing PGA memory is quicker than accessing SGA memory

Collections use more memory per session but improve performance.


Collection types
Associative arrays - PL/SQL-only datatype

Nested table
Varray (varying arrays) - can both be used in PL/SQL blocks as well as within SQL layer

Each type has its own characteristics and is best suited to different circumstances


Element - row
Index value - row number
Dense - Every index value between lowest and highest has a defined element
Sparse - One or more values between lowest and highest may be undefined

Elements in a collection are accessed with their unique index number
